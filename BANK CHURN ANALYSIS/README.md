## Bank Churn Prediction
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and build a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of customers leaving the bank. This will help the bank develop strategies to retain high-value customers.

Tools Used:
- Python for data analysis and modeling.
- Pandas for data manipulation and exploration.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing data trends.
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest).
